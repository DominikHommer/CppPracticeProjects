# Practice Repository for C++ Projects

This repository is dedicated to C++ programming projects and examples, aimed at demonstrating various concepts and techniques in C++ software development. Each subdirectory contains a standalone C++ project with its own specific focus, showcasing different aspects of the C++ language and its application.

## Projects

- [Dynamic Array Template](./dynamic_array/README.md) - A C++ template implementation for a dynamic array, illustrating the use of templates for type-independent data structures.
- [Linked List Template](./linked_list/README.md) - A C++ template implementation for a singly linked list, demonstrating the principles of dynamic memory management and object-oriented design.
- [Associative Array Template](./associative_array/README.md) - A C++ template implementation for an associative array, highlighting the use of operator overloading and custom data structures.
- [Filesystem](./filesystem/README.md) - Demonstrates the use of the C++17 filesystem library to perform file operations, enhancing the ability to interact with the system's file structure programmatically.
- [Template Practice](./template_practice/README.md) - Contains small exercises and examples focusing on C++ template programming, showcasing the power and flexibility of templates in generic programming.
- [Unix Style Text Tools](./unix_style_text_tools/README.md) - A collection of C++ programs designed to mimic the behavior of classic Unix text processing tools, showcasing the use of C++ in command-line utilities.
